# Retired Galago

This version of Galago is kept around for determining backwards-compatibility with Galago indexes and scoring. It supports no new features or development. 

- Extraneous dependencies have been removed!
- That means no HTML/Web server.
- No Wiki Parsing.
- No NLP.
- No galago typebuilder.
- No new tupleflow pipelines.
